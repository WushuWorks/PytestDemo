This repo demonstrates the usage of 'pytest'. Download pytest with the command below.   

`pip install -U pytest`  

Inside the project I document how and why pytest will work when called from the terminal with
the 'pytest' command assuming your working directory is the project's folder.  

As written this test demo will pass 7 tests in two files.
